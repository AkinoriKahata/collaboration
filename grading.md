## Participation

This is a combination of your *necessary* participation in class (if even just to ask questions), your participation on Piazza, and your PRs to this repo.

For example, I'm accepting PRs to add a `resources/local_copies/` directory with a `.pdf` version of each of the external links in the resources and inspiration pages!
If the original source material is taken offline, I want the local copies to fall back on.
Make sure to update the original links to the external material to include an additional small link (for example, a link like [chaos](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/publications/rtas19chaos.pdf) should be updated to look like this [chaos](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/publications/rtas19chaos.pdf)[*](https://github.com/gwu-iot/collaboration/blob/master/papers/rtas19chaos.pdf)) to the local contents.
