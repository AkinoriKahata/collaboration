# Project Criteria and Timeline

The educational objective for the project for this class is to:

- give you experience working in the IoT domain, including embedded device and cloud programming
- learn to work effectively in a team
- experienc taking a project from start to end of a complex project, from planning to design to implementation to integration to testing to demo
- apply the knowledge you've learned about how to make a secure IoT system

What follows are a set of requirements for the project.
There are potential exceptions to these requirements if properly motivated.
Discuss with Gabe if such an exception is warranted.

## Project Requirements

Each project must include

- IoT devices
- a cloud (or edge-cloud) component
- a security analysis of the system, and a design to mitigate the worst impacts of this
- the system must have a testing component, and documentation

Projects might put more emphasis on the embedded system construction, on the coordination between systems, on the interaction with the physical system, or on interesting sensing and actuation, but each project must have a token aspect of each of these.

## Timeline

The major checkpoints for the project follow.
The deadlines for each will be posted on Piazza.

1. *Group selection* - groups should have 3 members by default, though 4 can be argued for.
    Students working on research projects can argue for fewer members.
1. *Project proposal* - your group must provide a proposal for your project.
    These will be submitted via form.
    Your aim is to convince me that your project meets the educational objectives for the class, and the project requirements above.
1. *Project work distribution & timeline* - you must provide
    - a breakdown of the different components of the project
    - a timeline on when these will be completed
    - an enumeration and description of the interfaces between the components
    - an assignment of components to group members
