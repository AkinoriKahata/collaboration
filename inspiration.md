- Taking the classical [inverted pendumlum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owe0o0ynUbY) problem to the realm of cheap mobility with `edumips`.
- Using the keyboard as an [universal IoT notification/control](https://www.daskeyboard.com/x/x50q-rgb-mechanical-keyboard/) system.
- Using the voice control APIs of existing human-interactive cloud systems to [control your computer](https://www.instructables.com/id/IoTyper-Control-Your-PC-Via-Alexa-IoT/)
- Rethink something as simple as the [lighting](https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-RGB-WiFi-Lamp/) of an environment. 
    Super-cool when combined with sensors to change the lights interactively.
